For contributors 

1. Always clone dev branch and push your changes in your own branch
    git clone -b dev <repo_url>

2. After cloning always switch to your branch
    git checkout <branch_name>

3. Before pushing changes to dev, always take a pull from remote dev and resolve conflicts beforehand
    git pull origin dev
